# application
I made some changes to the way that it looked so that the categories are not going off the screen and the list is not too short. I also removed one of the milk entries. The only other changes I would have made would possibly 
to be to introduce a database for storing and updating information on the food, 
however I do not know what it's use is for. Also I tried to fix the way the sort 
is done for the pricing since coffee is out of order but I was unable to locate 
the scope.price.asc function to see what the problem might have been. It appears 
that the price is sorted by the first number it comes by in which for the coffee 
is a 1 when in reality the price is over 10 dollars total.

I hope this is what you were looking for, the github account said to contact the 
company so I hope this is correct. Thank you for your time and I look forward to 
hearing back from you
